# Lab 2 â†’ Docker

## Install Docker and setup dockerhub
```sh
# Arch Linux

# Setup Docker
sudo pacman -S docker
sudo systemctl start docker.service
sudo systemctl enable docker.service

# Setup Docker Compose
sudo pamac install docker-compose

# Login to DockerHub
sudo docker login
```

## Create 2 nginx containers, list, delete, stop..

### Run 2 `nginx` containers in both ports `8090` and `8091` and list them
- `-d` : for detached mode
- `-p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT` : bind the container port to the host machine port
- `--name CONTAINER_NAME` : name the container

### Delete and Stop the containers
- Stop and Start the container (the container still exists but either running or not)
![](assets/stop-start.png)

- Remove the container
![](assets/rm.png)

- Check the Logs of the container
![](assets/logs.png)

- Explore the content of the container

## Dockerize a web application and run it, check the layers and re-usability

For this scenario, we have created a simple Golang HTTP Server using the web framework [echo](https://echo.labstack.com). In golang the files `go.mod` and `go.sum` are responsible for managing the dependencies.
The Web app as a start just returns "Hello World" when you visit "http://localhost:1323".

The Dockerfile for the app is as follows:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine3.18

# Initiate a folder for the project called app
WORKDIR /app

# Move the files that are responsible for installing the dependencies 
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Move the rest of the files
COPY . .

# Build the project into an executable
RUN go build -o main .

# Run the executable
CMD ["/app/main"]
```
This is the output of building the image

When we change "Hello, World" to "Hello, There" and rebuild the docker image, the command `RUN go mod download` will be cached and the build will be faster, thanks to the layering system of docker.

### Run a database container and test the interaction
For this step, we have added a file called `kv.go` which has utilities to interact with **Redis**, an In-Memory Database. Next we changed the `main.go` file to add 2 routes, one to set a key-value pair and another to get the value of a key. The Redis hostname is passed as an environment variable to the container, called `KV_HOSTNAME`.

To simulate an interaction between 2 seperate containers, being the golang web server and an instance of Redis, we will use Docker network bridges. Here is how we have done it.

### Docker Compose
It is very obvious, that we have accomplished the previous response through running a lot of commands, and debugging it and changing anything will be a nightmare. So, we will use Docker Compose to automate the process and reduce the complexity and toil.
The same commands we have executed are equivalent to the following YAML file
```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  web:
    image: devops-demo-app
    ports:
      - 1323:1323
    environment:
      - KV_HOSTNAME=kv

  kv:
    image: redis:alpine3.18
    ports:
      - 6379

networks:
  default:
    name: web-app-net
```

### Deployment Options
Since our app is now dockerized, we can push it to a central repository for docker images, like DockerHub, whenever a new release is ready. In production, we can pull the image from DockerHub and run it on a server. 
Some of the good practices that we can follow are:
- Tag each docker image with a unique tag and not "latest"
- Use a CI/CD tool to automate the process of building and pushing the image to DockerHub
- While this is being a testing environment, for actual production applications, we need a centralized private repository for the images, like AWS ECR or GitLab Container Registry, since DockerHub is public and anyone can pull the image and run it.


### Jenkins Pipeline
To run Jenkins, we will use a docker image for it, for the ease and test only. In production, we will use a dedicated server for it.

After initiating the Jenkins server, we will create a pipeline that will pull the code from GitHub, build it, and push it to DockerHub, this is the Jenkinsfile for it:
```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  

  environment {
    DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('dockerhub')
  }

  stages {
      stage('Build Docker Image') {
        when {
            branch "dev"
        }

          steps {
            echo 'building ...'
            sh 'docker build -t niemandx/devops-demo-app:latest 1-docker/apps'
         }
      }

      stage('deploy docker images!') {
           when {
              branch "dev"
          }
          steps {
            echo 'Login to DockerHub'
            sh 'echo $DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_PSW | docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_USR --password-stdin'

            echo 'building ...'
            sh 'docker push niemandx/devops-demo-app:latest'
         }
      }
  }

    post {
        always {
            sh 'docker logout'
        }
    }
}
```
This pipelines does as follows:
- Pull the code from GitHub
- Build the docker image
- Push the image to DockerHub using the credentials we have added to Jenkins `DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS`

To extend the pipeline a little bit, We have added another step to scan for vulnerable dependencies using [Snyk](https://snyk.io) and fail the build if any vulnerabilities are found.
Plus, we are now calculating the hash of the image and tagging it with it, and eliminate the `latest` tag, since it is not a good practice to use it.

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  
  environment {
    DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('dockerhub')
    SNYK_TOKEN = credentials('snyk')
  }

  stages {
      stage('Build Docker Image') {
        when {
            branch "dev"
        }

          steps {
            echo 'building ...'
            sh 'HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) && docker build -t niemandx/devops-demo-app:$HASH 1-docker/apps'
         }
      }

      stage('scan for vulnerable packages!') {
          when {
              branch "dev"
          }
          steps {
            echo 'Login to Snyk'
            sh 'snyk auth $SNYK_TOKEN'

            echo 'scanning ...'
            sh 'snyk test'
         }
      }


      stage('deploy docker images!') {
           when {
              branch "dev"
          }
          steps {
            echo 'Login to DockerHub'
            sh 'echo $DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_PSW | docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_USR --password-stdin'
            
            echo 'building ...'
            sh 'HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) && docker push niemandx/devops-demo-app:$HASH'
         }
      }
  }

    post {
        always {
            sh 'docker logout'
        }
    }
}
```
